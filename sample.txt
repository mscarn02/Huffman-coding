Processing cryptographic algorithms can be really taxing for a simple processor and often
there is a tradeoff between speed and security. To address these concerns, we have
dedicated processors - TIâ€™s sitara embedded processors: AM37x, AM335x, AM43x etc.
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely adopted symmetric encryption
algorithm used to secure sensitive data in various applications. Implementing AES on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offers flexibility, reconfigurability, and parallel
processing capabilities, making it an attractive choice for cryptographic applications.
